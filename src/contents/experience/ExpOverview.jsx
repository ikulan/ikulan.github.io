        A few years ago, I began a new life journey when I moved to the
        beautiful west coast of Canada. Soon after, I became a mother and
        initiated a career gap. Now, things have settled down, and I&apos;m
        happy and excited to pursue my passion for software development.

        I&apos;m actively seeking opportunities to reenter the workforce.
        Meanwhile, I keep going on enhancing my skills and gaining knowledge to
        elevate my professional profile. I am fully prepared to bring my
        expertise to the table and eagerly anticipate long-term career growth
        with my next team.
